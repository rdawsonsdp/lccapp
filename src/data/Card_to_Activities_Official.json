Whether it’s falling in love with a passion project, quitting a people-pleasing pattern, or just needing space to feel something—this energy wants them to start something that actually lights them up from the inside.\nHow to Love Them Through It:\nBe their safe space. Don’t rush them. Ask questions like, “What feels true for you right now?” instead of offering unsolicited solutions. Celebrate their tiny wins and big feelings. Encourage their solo time—this isn’t distance, it’s restoration. And if they want to cry and create in the same hour? Pass the tissues and the vision board supplies.",
  "A♣": "What They’re Going Through:\nThis is “idea explosion” energy. Their brain’s a Pinterest board of podcast titles, business ideas, Google Docs, and shower thoughts. It’s exciting and overwhelming. Clarity’s coming, but first? Chaos. Let it.\nHow to Love Them Through It:\nLet them ramble. Seriously—half their genius comes out when they talk it through. Offer to be their sounding board (no fixing, just listening). Say, “That’s a dope idea!” more than “But how would that work?” And please—don’t kill their flow with critiques before they’ve even finished dreaming.",
  "A♦": "What They’re Going Through:\nThis is new money energy—but not just any money. It’s money that aligns with their values, their vision, and their vibes. They’re feeling called to earn in ways that reflect who they are now, not who they had to be to survive. Cue: pricing shifts, passion offers, and wait… I can actually get paid to be this version of me?\nHow to Love Them Through It:\nSupport their new standards. Don’t panic if they raise their rates or start canceling low-energy commitments—they’re leveling up. Ask how you can help them feel abundant and aligned. Remind them they don’t have to choose between money and meaning—they can have both, and you believe that too.",
  "A♠": "What They’re Going Through:\nThis is the “begin again” card. They’re outgrowing old titles, outdated dreams, and dusty definitions of success. It’s not just a rebrand—it’s a rebirth. Something deep inside is saying, “We’re not doing it that way anymore,” and they’re finally listening. Scary? Yes. Sacred? Also yes.\nHow to Love Them Through It:\nMirror back their evolution. Don’t cling to who they used to be—celebrate who they’re becoming. Offer space, not pressure.

  "2♥": "What They’re Going Through:\nThey’re in their “I need real connection or I will spiral” phase. Every interaction feels deeper, louder, more intimate than usual.

Think “heart expansion with a side of vulnerability hangover.”\nHow to Love Them Through It:\nDon’t flinch when they feel deeply. Be soft with them, but sturdy too—they’re not looking for someone to fix them, just someone who won’t bail mid-heartquake. Show up consistently. Send the text. Ask real questions. Tell them how you feel. They want connection that feels like truth, not performance.",
  "2♣": "What They’re Going Through:\nThey’re all about communication right now—texts, calls, long convos that feel like TED Talks mixed with heart-to-hearts.

  "2♦": "What They’re Going Through:\nThey’re rethinking what “us vs. the world” looks like—financially.

  "3♣": "What They’re Going Through:\nMentally, they’re ping-ponging between ten ideas before breakfast.

Make them feel emotionally held, not emotionally responsible for keeping the whole relationship alive.",
  "4♣": "What They’re Going Through:\nTheir brain is craving order. They’re in “clarity or collapse” mode. Confusion stresses them all the way out, and vague conversations will get you ghosted. They’re craving communication that feels clean, direct, and nourishing—not chaotic or performative.\nHow to Love Them Through It:\nSpeak clearly. Don’t make them decode you like a breakup tweet.
